https://github.com/lune-org/lune vibe-coded to add a proxy library called "proxy" which adds support for socks5 ws:// and wss:// websocket proxy connections.

the tests are not fucking passing LMAO

tcp just didnt cut my usecase, it does support tls but i have to connect to the websocket with tls.. not the socks5 proxy server..
so if you have this specific issue just install cargo and compile this lmao
