https://github.com/lune-org/lune vibe-coded to add a proxy library called "proxy" which adds support for socks5 ws:// and wss:// websocket proxy connections.

the tests are not fucking passing LMAO

tcp just didnt cut my usecase, it does support tls but i have to connect to the websocket with tls.. not the socks5 proxy server..
if you have this specific issue just install cargo and compile this lmao


they'd have to expose tls functions or something to do that.
Or make ffi so I could use a C or Rust implementation just for that.

hopefully FFI DOESNT TAKE ANOTHER WHOLE YEAR TO COME TO LUNE PLEASE FILIP I BEG OF YOU
ILL BUY YOU 5 (whole!!) CUPS OF COFFEES IN YOUR BUY ME A COFFEE LINK PLEASE
